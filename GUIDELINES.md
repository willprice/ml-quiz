## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to come up with a set of varied quiz
questions and answers to test someone's knowledge of machine learning.

## Marking
You will primarily be marked on the extent to which your questions test someone's understanding of the material, and on the variety of question styles, difficulty levels, and material covered.

* In order to pass at 40% you need to have produced 12 questions, one for
  each of the 12 chapters in the book (this includes chapters 4 and 10
  which are not part of the examinable material) and **two for each of the 6
  question types (parameter answer_type)**. Each question should be at
  difficulty level 2 or higher, and all fields in the JSON format should
  be populated (explanations, hints, workings, etc.).

* In order to pass at 70% you need to have produced **24 questions**, each
  covering a different section in the book. Your questions should have an
  **average difficulty level of at least 3**, all fields in the JSON format
  should be populated, and the conditions for a pass at 40% should be
  satisfied.

* **Each question at difficulty level 5 will score an additional 5%.**

In marking we will review, and if necessary adjust, the reported
difficulty level; **any downward adjustment will lose marks
proportionally**. Similarly, we will judge the quality of the questions,
explanations, hints, workings etc. and subtract marks proportionally if
there is room for improvement.
