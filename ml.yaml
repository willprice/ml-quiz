    Given the training data

    $$\mathbf{x} =
      \begin{pmatrix}
        3 & 3 \\
        1 & 0 \\
        1 & 2 \\
        2 & 3 \\
        2 & 1 \\
      \end{pmatrix}$$

    with the labels:

    $$\mathbf{y} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        1 \\
        0 \\
        0 \\
        1 \\
      \end{pmatrix}$$

    where an instance belonging to the $\oplus$ class is represented by
    $1$ in $\mathbf{y}$, and an instance belonging to the $\ominus$
    class by $0$.

    Classify the test instance $(0, 1)$ using the 3 nearest neighbours
    classifier with Euclidean distances by calculation

  answers:
    - correctness: "+"
      explanation: "The nearest points to $(0, 1)$ are $(1, 0)$, $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$"
      answer: "$\\oplus$"
    - correctness: "-"
      answer: "$\\ominus$"

    We need to find the distance between our test point and every point
    in the training data set.

    First we find the distance between the test point and training
    points in each dimension.

    $$\mathbf{x} - (0, 1) =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      3 & 2 \\
      1 & -1 \\
      1 & 1 \\
      2 & 2 \\
      2 & 0 \\
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    We can then apply our distance measure to work out the distances.

    $$\mathbf{D(x, (0, 1))} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \sqrt{(3^2 + 2^2)} \\
      \sqrt{(1^2 + {(-1)}^2)} \\
      \sqrt{(1^2 + 1^2)} \\
      \sqrt{(2^2 + 2^2)} \\
      \sqrt{(2^2 + 0^2)} \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      3.6 \\
      1.4 \\
      1.4 \\
      2.8 \\
      2 \\
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    The 2nd, 3rd and 5th entries are the closest to the test point,
    looking this up in our training data vector $\mathbf{x}$ we see they
    correspond to the following points, $(1, 0)$, $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$,
    which each have the classes $\oplus$, $\ominus$, $\oplus$ respectively.
    We take the majority class as the prediction for our test point, $\oplus$.

    First plot the data then see whether you can visually identify the
    points that are closest.

    KNN can be modified to produce probabilities by calcuating the
    $\frac{\#\mathrm{positive}}{\#\mathrm{positive} + \#\mathrm{negative}}$
