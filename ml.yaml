  question: |
    Given the training data $$\\mathbf{x} =
      \begin{pmatrix}
        3 & 3 \\
        1 & 0 \\
        1 & 2 \\
        2 & 3 \\
        2 & 1 \\
      \end{pmatrix}$$
    with the labels: $$\\mathbf{y} =
      \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        1 \\
        0 \\
        0 \\
        1 \\
      \end{pmatrix}$$
    where an instance belonging to the $\oplus$ class is represented
    by $1$ in $\mathbf{y}$, and an instance belonging to the
    $\ominus$ class by $0$.

    Classify the test instance $(0, 1)$
    using the 3 nearest neighbours classifier by calculation
  images: []
  problem_type: calculation
  answers:
    - correctness: "+"
      explanation: "The nearest points to $(0, 1)$ are $(1, 0)$, $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$"
      answer: "$\\oplus$"
    - correctness: "-"
      answer: "$\\ominus$"
  workings: "how to arrive at the correct answer and why all the others are incorrect"
