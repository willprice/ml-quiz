question:
  - Given the coverage plot in Fig. 1 depicting the performance of three classifiers and
    the details below, determine the dominant class by considering their mapping to
    a ROC curve. Then compute its accuracy and average recall.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    Pos&= 25\\
    Neg&= 75\\
    \end{align}
    $$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    TP1&= 10\\
    TP2&=20\\
    TP3&= 20\\
    \end{align}
    $$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    FP1&= 15\\
    FP2&= 25\\
    FP3&= 40\\
    \end{align}
    $$

      The average recall of the best classifier

  <p>
  In a coverge plot, classifiers with the same accuracy are connected
  by line segments with slope 1. However, coverage plots do not take
  account of different class distributions. For this reason we should
  consider its normalised version which is referred to as a ROC plot
  that explicitly takes the class distribution into account.
  </p>

  <p>
  From the given coverage plot we can conclude that C2 is superior to
  C3, while they both have the same number of true positives, C2 has a
  lower number of false positives. However, because of the different
  class distributions we cannot confirm that C1 is equivalent to C2
  even if they have the same accuracy.
  </p>

  <p>
  To be able to graphically represent the classifier performance differences we
  have to normalise the data which will make noticable that they have
  different average recalls.  This is due to the fact that even if the
  differences on the x and y axis do might include an equal amount of
  false and true positives instances, because the number of negatives
  instances is higher than the number of positive instances, the
  increase on the true positive axis will have a higher weight. This
  can be also observed when computing for both C1 nad C2 their true
  positive / negatives rates that are included in the computation of
  average recall as follows:
  </p>

  $$\text{average recall} = \frac{TPR + TNR}{2}$$

  For each classifier compute their accuracy and average recall to aid you with
  deciding whether your choice is indeed the best classifier.

  Test the students ability to interpret the visualisation methods of a
  classification performance and the mapping of a coverage plot to a ROC curve.

  Complexity 3 because it requires a deep understanding of assessing classification
  performance and involves computing the accuracy and average recall in order to make
  a competent decision having no representation of an equivalent ROC plot .
