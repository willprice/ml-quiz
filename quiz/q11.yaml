  <p>
  Given the fallowing hyphothesis space and the below table of instances belonging
  to 2 different species of fish, associate each red colored path with its
  corresponding coverage plot.
  </p>

  <table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Instance</th>
      <th>Class</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>p1 : length = 3 & weight = 5 & scales = few</td>
      <td>+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>p2 : length = 4 & weight = 5 & scales = few</td>
      <td>+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>p3 : length = 3 & weight = 6 & scales = few</td>
      <td>+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>n1 : length = 3 & weight = 6 & scales = many</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>n2 : length = 4 & weight = 6 & scales = many</td>
      <td>-</td>

      <td>n3 : length = 4 & weight = 6 & scales = few</td>
      <td>-</td>

  Each level of the hypothesis space will labelled as fallows for
  representation purposes: the most general generalisation with 1 to the
  least general generalisation labbeled with 4.
  </p>

  <p>
  Fallowing this find the most general consistent hyphotesis using the
  MGConsistent(C,N) algorithm and output the label of that node given that
  they are labelled in ascending order form the most general hypothesis to
  the least general one, from left to right.
  </p>
  <p>
  (eg.The most general hypothesis will be labelled as 1.)

  Concept learning can be seen as the search for the most optimal path through
  the hypothesis space. Therefore, we are concerned of the most general hypothesis
  that best separates the postive instances from the negatives ones.
  </p>
  <p>
  To aid our understanding of each path separability of the data we dispalyed
  their ROC curves by fallowing each path in the hypothesis space from the
  least general generalisation to the most general one, the empty concept.
  That means that each path's corresponding coverage plot will customary pass
  through ROC buttom in the case of not covering any examples and ROC heaven
  in the case of an empty concept.
  </p>
  <p>
  The task will require taking each sample and classifying it using each hypothesis.
  In the end we will count the number of positives and negatives that are classified
  by each logical expression in the hypothesis space and for each path we will
  represent those values using a ROC curve where the most general hypothesis will
  be found in ROC heaven.
  </p>

  <p>
  Taking as an example Path 1 we start from the logical expression
  length = 3 & weight=5 & scales =many that classifies 0+ and 0- and
  represent it at the origin of our coverage curve. Then we move on to its
  upper bound length = 3 & scales=many that classifies 0+ 1- misslabelling
  n1 as being positive and so on untill we reach the hypothesis that is
  represented as ROC heaven.
  </p>

  <p>
  As a method to check our results, we can notice that while adding extra
  specialisation our samples will also decrease in their number as the hypothesis
  will become stricter.
  </p>

  <p>
  The task will require taking each sample and classifying it using the hypothesis
  space. Ouputing each hypotesis number of true and false positives will
  later aid the conversion of each path's results to the corresponding ROC curve in
  order to visualise their accuracy.
  </p>

comments: |
  The task in hand requires acknowledging the ability of concept learning to
  identify an optimal path through the hypothesis space. Therefore, we test
  the ability of assesing the accuracy of different hypothesis using as
  their reprsentations ROC curves and given labbelled examples.
  <br>
  Moreover, as finding more general consistent hypothesis is considerably
  more involved than finding least general complete ones, we also tested the
  ability of using the MGConsistent(C,N) algorithm to find the most general
  consistent specialisations of a concept.
