      Each level of the hypothesis space will labelled as fallows for
      representation purposes: the most general generalisation with 1 to the
      least general generalisation labbeled with 4.

      the least general one, from left to right.

      Concept learning can be seen as the search for the most optimal path through
      the hypothesis space. Therefore, we are concerned of the most general hypothesis
      that best separates the postive instances from the negatives ones.
      </p>
      <p>
      To aid our understanding of each path separability of the data we dispalyed
      their ROC curves by fallowing each path in the hypothesis space from the
      least general generalisation to the most general one, the empty concept.
      That means that each path's corresponding coverage plot will customary pass
      through ROC buttom in the case of not covering any examples and ROC heaven
      in the case of an empty concept.
      </p>
      <p>
      The task will require taking each sample and classifying it using each hypothesis.
      In the end we will count the number of positives and negatives that are classified
      by each logical expression in the hypothesis space and for each path we will
      represent those values using a ROC curve where the most general hypothesis will
      be found in ROC heaven.
      </p>

      <p>
      Taking as an example Path 1 we start from the logical expression
      length = 3 & weight=5 & scales =many that classifies 0+ and 0- and
      represent it at the origin of our coverage curve. Then we move on to its
      upper bound length = 3 & scales=many that classifies 0+ 1- misslabelling
      n1 as being positive and so on untill we reach the hypothesis that is
      represented as ROC heaven.
      </p>

      <p>
      As a method to check our results, we can notice that while adding extra
      specialisation our samples will also decrease in their number as the hypothesis
      will become stricter.
      </p>


    hint: |
      <p>
      The task will require taking each sample and classifying it using the hypothesis
      space. Ouputing each hypotesis number of true and false positives will
      later aid the conversion of each path's results to the corresponding ROC curve in
      order to visualise their accuracy.
      </p>

    comments: |
      The task in hand requires acknowledging the ability of concept learning to
      identify an optimal path through the hypothesis space. Therefore, we test
      the ability of assesing the accuracy of different hypothesis using as
      their reprsentations ROC curves and given labbelled examples.
      <br>
      Moreover, as finding more general consistent hypothesis is considerably
      more involved than finding least general complete ones, we also tested the
      ability of using the MGConsistent(C,N) algorithm to find the most general
      consistent specialisations of a concept.
