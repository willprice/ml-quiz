  <p>
  Bayesian Networks (BNs) graphically model the conditional dependence
  and independence of events. A BN is modelled as a directed acyclic
  graph (DAG) where each node represents and event, and a directed edge
  from node A to node B denotes that A is conditionally dependent upon
  B.
  </p>

  <p>
  Select the BNs that make the same conditional independence assumptions
  as the BN in Fig 1.
