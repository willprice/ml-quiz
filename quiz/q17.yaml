  <p>
  Bayesian Networks (BNs) graphically model the conditional dependence
  and independence of events. A BN is modelled as a directed acyclic
  graph (DAG) where each node represents an event, a directed edge
  from node A to node B denotes the conditional dependence of A upon
  B.
  </p>

  <p>
  Each BN represents a class of probability distributions with certain
  conditional independence properties. A distribution can be realised by
  associating a conditional probability table with each node in the graph.
  </p>

  <p>
  BNs can be used to model scenarios involving multiple random
  variables. Random variables become nodes and edges represent
  conditional dependence.  Once formulated, a network can be analysed to
  find out whether two sets of variables $X_a, X_b$ are conditionally
  independent conditioned upon a set of variables $X_c$, this is denoted
  $X_a \cind X_b | X_c$.
  </p>

  <p>
  $x_1$ is independent of $x_2$ conditioned on $x_3$ providing $x_1$ and
  $x_2$ are <b>d-separated</b> by $x_3$. d-separation is a property of
  three sets of nodes expressing certain properties about paths.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Baye's Ball</b> is a method of determining d-separation between
  sets $X_a$, $X_b$ and $X_c$ which tells us whether $X_a \cind X_b | X_c$
  </p>

  <p>
  Using the Bayes-Ball algorithm determine whether the following
  statements are true.

  <p>
  To prove a statement $X_a \cind X_b | X_c$, the Bayes-Ball algorithm
  plants a ball at each of the nodes in $X_a$, shades the nodes in $X_c$
  then using rules derived from canonical graphs determines whether any
  ball can reach a node in $X_b$, if no ball can reach any node in $X_b$, then the
  statement holds.
  </p>

  <p>
  The following table shows the rules for determining whether a Bayes
  ball can traverse a given node given the context of the node (it's neighbours).
  Nodes that are conditioned are in orange/yellow. A purple arrow from
  $x_1$ to $x_2$ denotes the conditional dependence of $x_2$ on $x_1$.
  The green arrows denote the travel of the Bayes ball, if a ball cannot
  pass a node, the arrow is terminated with a vertical line.

  The valid paths given below are justified by use of the rules above,
  if a rule has been used, it's rule number is given, if the rule was
  the conditioned dual then it is denoted by the number followed by
  prime, e.g. rule 1' corresponds to the rule in the top right corner.

  <b>Q1</b>
  <br/>
  To determine whether
  $X_a \cind X_b | X_c$ where $X_a = \{x_1\}, X_b = \{x_5, x_8\}, X_c = \{x_4, x_6\}$ holds,
  we plant a ball at $x_1$ and try to reach $x_5$ or $x_8$. The ball can
  traverse $x_1 - x_3 - x_6$ following rule 1, but then cannot travel
  any further. There are no paths from $X_a$ to $X_b$ hence $X_a \cind X_b | X_c$ holds.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Q2</b>
  <br/>
  To determine whether
  $X_a \cind X_b | X_c$ where $X_a = \{x_1\}, X_b = \{x_2, x_7\}, X_c = \{x_3, x_8\}$
  holds, we use the Bayes-ball algorithm planting a ball at $x_1$.
  Since  $x_2$ can be reach from $x_1$ along the path: $x_1 - x_3 - x_2$ using the rule 2'
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Q3</b>
  <br/>
  To determine whether
  $X_a \cind X_b | X_c$ where $X_a = \{x_3, x_7\}, X_b = \{x_5, x_8\}, X_c = \{x_4\}$ holds,
  we plant two balls, one at $x_3$ and the other at $x_7$, then if
  either ball reaches $x_5$ or $x_8$ we will have disproved the
  statement.
  Path from $x_7$ to $x_5$: $x_7 - x_5$ by rule 4. As you can see from the figure, the balls can also reach $x_8$ 
  </p>
hint: |
  Write down the Bayes-ball node traversal rules and then begin applying
  them from nodes in $X_a$. When can you conclude whether the two sets
  are conditionally independent based on the node traversal?

  <p>
  Tests the student's knowledge of Bayesian Networks, what they
  represent and how to determine whether two sets of variables are
  conditionally independent on another set of variables using Bayes-Ball.
  </p>

  <p>
  Complexity 5 because Bayesian networks aren't covered and there is a
  lot of prerequisite knowledge necessary to be able to complete this
  question.
