  boosting to those most applicable to bagging.

answer_type: sort
answers:
  - correctness: "1"
    answer: Decision tree stumps
    explanation: |
      Decision tree stumps have extremely high bias as they only split
      on a single feature hence graphically they separate the instance
      space with an axis parallel decision boundary.
  - correctness: "2"
    answer: Linear regression
    explanation: |
      Linear regression is high bias due to the simplicity of the model,
      although it can express more complex decision boundaries than
      decision tree stumps
  - correctness: "3"
    answer: SVM
    explanation: |
      SVMs have high bias, similar to that of linear regression, however
      since a SVM's decision boundary is defined soley by support
      vectors, it cannot be used with boosting as weights cannot be
      accounted for with SVMs.
  - correctness: "4"
    answer: KNN with small K.
    explanation: |
      When K is small KNN produces models with high variance that are
      prone to overfitting the training data. This model is most suited
      to bagging
workings: |
  The algorithms' bias and variance characteristics are enumerated,
  those with bias issues are more suitable to boosting providing they
  support weighted training examples. Bagging helps reduce variance so
  is suitable for high variance methods and does not require weight
  training example support.
hint: |
  Bagging is good for reducing variance and boosting for reducing bias.
comments: |
  Tests the student's knowledge of which models are suitable for bagging
  or boosting.
  <br>
  Since this is relatively straightforward with little complexity and no
  calculation it scores a difficulty of 2.
