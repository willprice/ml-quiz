  $\text{Agglomerative merging}$
  <br>
  Given the set of labelled instances:

  \begin{align}
  \oplus \oplus \ominus \oplus \oplus \oplus \ominus \ominus \oplus \ominus\\
  \end{align}

  perform supervised discretisation by means of aglomerative merging with Q being
  the $X{2}$ statistic scoring function ( chi square statistic function) and with
  the stoping criterion of having in the end only 3 bins.

  If we start with:
  \begin{align}
  |\oplus |\oplus |\ominus |\oplus |\oplus |\oplus |\ominus |\ominus |\oplus |\ominus|\\
  \end{align}
  what are the numbers of delimitars that will dissapear during the merging process?
  <br>
  (e.g they range from the first one labelled 1 to tha last one labelled 11)

  Following the algorithm:

  <pre>
  <code class="python">
  AggloMerge(S, f, Q)

  Input: set of labelled instances S ranked on features values f(x);scoring function Q.
  Output: sequences of threshold.

  initialise bins to data points with the same scores;
  merge consecutives pure bins;
  repeat
    evaluate Q on consecutive bin pairs;
    merge the pairs with best Q (unless they invoke the stopping criterion);
  untill no futher merges are possible;
  return thresholds between bins;
  </code>
  </pre>

  we will start out with the beans:
  \begin{align}
  |\oplus |\oplus |\ominus |\oplus |\oplus |\oplus |\ominus |\ominus |\oplus |\ominus|\\
  \end{align}
  and then merge the consecutives pure bins as:
  \begin{align}
  |\oplus \oplus |\ominus |\oplus \oplus \oplus |\ominus \ominus |\oplus |\ominus|\\
  \end{align}

  The following step will be to evaluate the consecutives bin using the $X{2}$ statistic.
  <br>
  To ease our competition we will introduce the next method do compute the $X{2}$ score.
  <br>
  Given the following contingency table:
    <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th> </th>
        <th>Left bin</th>
        <th>Right bin</th>
        <th> </th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>$\oplus$</td>
        <td>a</td>
        <td>b</td>
        <td>a + b</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$\ominus$</td>
        <td>c</td>
        <td>d</td>
        <td>c + d</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> </td>
        <td>a + c</td>
        <td>b + d</td>
        <td>a + b + c + d</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    then
    \begin{align}
    X{2} = \frac{(ad - bc){2} (a + b + c + d)}{(a + b)(c + d)(a + c)(b + d)} \\
    \end{align}

    So applying the above method to our example we will obtain:
    \begin{align}
    X{2}(1,2) = \frac{2{2}*3}{2*2} = 3;\\
    X{2}(2,3) = \frac{(-3){2}*4}{3*3} = 4; \\
    X{2}(3,4) = \frac{6{2}*5}{2*2*3*3} = 5;\\
    X{2}(4,5) = \frac{(-2){2}*3}{2*2} = 3;\\
    X{2}(5,6) = \frac{1*2}{1} = 2;\\
    \end{align}

    This tell us that the fifth and sixth bins are first to be merged, leading to:
    \begin{align}
    |\oplus \oplus |\ominus |\oplus \oplus \oplus |\ominus \ominus |\oplus \ominus|\\
    \end{align}
    We then recompute the $X{2}$ values, in fact only those involving the newly
    merged bins need to be re-computed:
    \begin{align}
    X{2}(1,2) = \frac{2{2}*3}{2*2} = 3; (already computed)\\
    X{2}(2,3) = \frac{(-3){2}*4}{3*3} = 4; (already computed)\\
    X{2}(3,4) = \frac{6{2}*5}{2*2*3*3} = 5;(already computed)\\
    X{2}(4,5) = \frac{(1-2){2}*4}{2*2*3} = 0.3; (re-computed)\\
    \end{align}
    to conclude that this time we will merge the fourth and fifth bins into:
    \begin{align}
    |\oplus \oplus |\ominus |\oplus \oplus \oplus |\ominus \ominus \oplus \ominus|\\
    \end{align}

    We then recompute the $X{2}$ values:
    \begin{align}
    X{2}(1,2) = \frac{2{2}*3}{2*2} = 3; (already computed)\\
    X{2}(2,3) = \frac{(-3){2}*4}{3*3} = 4; (already computed)\\
    X{2}(3,4) = \frac{(9-1){2}*7}{3*3*4*4} = 3.11;(re-computed)\\
    \end{align}
    so we will merge the first and the second bins obtaining:
    \begin{align}
    |\oplus \oplus \ominus |\oplus \oplus \oplus |\ominus \ominus \oplus \ominus|\\
    \end{align}
    and stop according to our stoping condition.
