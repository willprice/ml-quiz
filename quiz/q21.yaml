  was performed. Determine whether the following null hypothesis can be
  rejected or not by means of a Wilcoxon's signed-rank test with $\alpha=0.01$.
  </p>

  <p>
  Null hypothesis, $h_0$: The difference between the average recall of the trained SVM and Ridge regression models follow a symmetric distribution around 0

  <p>
  The Wilcoxon's signed-rank test can be executed as follows
    <ol>
      <li>Determine the critical value given $n$, $\alpha$, and one-tail/two-tail</li>
      <li>Calculate the difference in performance between the pair of algorithms under test</li>
      <li>Rank the absolute differences in descending order (rank 1 for largest difference)</li>
      <li>Calculate two sum of ranks, one sum of ranks for positive differences, and the other for negative differences</li>
      <li>Select the lowest sum of ranks and compare to the critical value, if it is less than or equal, reject the null hypothesis</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
  $\alpha = 0.01$ as given in the question and $n = 12$ since there are
  12 datasets, the test is
  <a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/tail_tests.htm">
  two tailed</a> since we're interested in whether the difference a
  symmetric distribution with mean greater than 0 <b>or</b> less than 0.
  </p>

  <p>
  Using the above information we can lookup the critical value: $7$

  <p>
  $W^{+}$ denotes the sum of ranks for positive differences and $W^{-}$ for negative differences.
  </p>

  <p>
  $W^{+} = 51$, and $W^{-} = 23$. Comparing the smaller sum of ranks to
  the critical value: $23 > 7$ so we cannot reject the null hypothesis
  at $\alpha = 0.01$.
  </p>

hint: |
  You'll have to lookup the critical value for $\alpha$ either in a
  <a href="http://www.bios.unc.edu/~mhudgens/bios/662/2008fall/wilcox_t.pdf">table</a>,
  or use a statistical package like scipy or R.

  <p>
  Tests the student's knowledge of Wilcoxon's signed-rank test for
  determining whether there is a statistically significant difference
  between two models evaluated over multiple datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
  Complexity 3 because there is quite a lot of calculation although it's
  fairly formulaic. One potential trip up would be using critical values
  for a one tailed test.
