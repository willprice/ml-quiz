question: |
  In our measurements we expect some variations to occur from one measurement to
  the next. In Chapter 12 we delt with different procedures that use the averaging
  of k measurements to estimate our variance.

  Match the fallowing concepts to their definitions or properties:

answers:
  - correctness: "Cross-validation procedure"
    answer: |
      "is applied by randomly partitioning the data in k parts or 'folds', where
      one fold is set aside for testing and the model will be trained on the
      remaining k-1 folds. The process will be repeted k times until each fold
      has been used for testing once."
    explanation: "theory presented in Chapter 12.2 pag 348 of Machine Learning by Peter Flach"
  - correctness: "Leave-one-out cross-validation"
    answer: |
      "it is used when having a small number of instances and implies setting n folds
      and training on all but one test instance, process repeated n times. "
    explanation: "theory presented in Chapter 12.2 pag 348 of Machine Learning by Peter Flach"
  - correctness: "Stratified cross-validation(e.g. 10 times 10-fold cross-validation)"
    answer: |
      "it is applied if we expect the learning algorithm to be sensitive to the
      class distribution because it aims to achieving roughly the same class
      distribution in each fold. It can therefore pe repeated for different random
      partitions into folds and the results averaged again to further reduce variance
      in our estimates."

workings: |
  Leave-one-out cross-validation and stratified cross-validation are specific variations
  of the cross-validation procedure, all aiming to decrease the data variance through
  means such that it will not affect the model performance.

hint: |
  Review Chapter 12 on Machine Learning Experiments that deals with external impediments
  of training an accurate model such as variation of the data and uncertainty of
  measurements.
comments: |
  The question tests basic concepts that can aid decreasing the impact of error
  measurements on models performance.
