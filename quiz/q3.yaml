    <p>
    We're trying to find out the characteristics of rodents, so a
    variety of animals were sampled and certain features about them
    were recorded. We'd like to come up with some conjunctive concepts
    to determine whether a certain animal is a rodent based on it's
    features.
    </p>

    <p>
    The examples below cover the full range of feature values, (i.e.
    there is no 'Very long' value for ear size)
    </p>

  - correctness: 1
    answer: "2"
    explanation: The number of hypotheses that cover all the positive examples
  - correctness: 2
    answer: "16"
    explanation: |
      The number of hypotheses that cover none of the negative
      examples and at least one of the positive examples
  - correctness: 3
    answer: "0"
    explanation: There are no complete AND consistent hypotheses

  <p>
  The hypothesis space of all conjunctive concepts needs to be
  computed, then for each conjunctive concept we have to count the
  number of positive and negative examples, from that we can derive
  the size of each of the sets of hypotheses.
  </p>

  <p>
  First it's sensible to reoder the table to separate positive and
  negative examples to help ease counting.

  <p>
    Each feature can take on one of several values, each conjunctive
    literal will use an internal disjunction of these values. The
    possible internal disjunctions are calculated as they are
    necessary to build the hypothesis space.

    We denote the internal disjuction of all possible values with '-'
    as this functions as a wildcard, a "don't care" value, since the
    feature can take on any value and we will still match the instance.
  </p>


  <p>
   Every possible hypothesis is computed by the combination over all
   the possible interal disjunctions of each feature, this forms
   something similar to a truth table and can be constructed in a
   similar fashion.

    Now the hypothesis space has be computed, the sizes of the sets
    $A, B, V$ can be derived.
  </p>

  <p>
    $A$, the set of all complete hypotheses will contain all
    hypothesis the cover all positive examples; they will has a
    positive count of 4. Counting the hypotheses above there are only
    2 hypotheses covering all positive examples.
  </p>

  <p>
    $B$, the set of all consistent hypotheses that cover 1 or more
    positive examples can be computed by counting all hypotheses that
    cover no negative examples (the definition of consistent) and then
    counting the number of selected hypotheses that have 1 or more
    positive examples. There are 16 of these.
  </p>

hint: |
  Enumerate the possible conjunctive hypotheses and count how many
  positive and negative examples are covered
comments: |
  Tests the student's knowledge of conjunctive concepts, how to form
  the hypothesis space of conjunctive concepts, the definitions of
  complete and consistent hypotheses and version space.
  <br>
  Complexity 3 because it involves enumerating the hypothesis space
  then building some sets of hypotheses based on definitional knolwedge.
