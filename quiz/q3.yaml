  <p>
  A path through hypothesis space corresponds to a coverage curve.
  Starting at the most specialised concept and terminating at the empty
  concept we count examples of each class that are covered by the
  current hypothesis until reaching the root of the lattice.
  </p>

  <p>
  Once the hypotheses along the path have been traversed and the
  examples covered counted, we can draw the coverage plots.

  <p>
  We will reference hypotheses using the Rule Id in the table above to
  save having to repetitiously write them out!
  </p>

  <p>
  A coverage curve is produced by traversing a path from the least
  general hypothesis to most general. Initially a point at $(0,0)$ is added,
  For each hypothesis traversed, a point for the number of positive and
  negative examples covered is added. Finally the default rule covers
  all examples so a point is added $(\#Pos, \#Neg)$
  </p>

  <p>
  For Path 1, the least general hypothesis, rule 2, covers no examples,
  so we add a point at $(0, 0)$, the next hypothesis, rule 3, covers 1
  negative example, so we add a point at $(1, 0)$, next the rule 4
  covers 2 positives and 1 negative (the same one the previous rule
  covered), we add a point $(2, 1)$, finally the default rule, rule 1,
  covers all positive and negative examples so a point at $(3, 3)$ is
  added. The coverage plot we have produced corresponds exactly to
  coverage plot 3.
  </p>

  <p>
  Path 2 gives the coverage curve: $(0, 0) - (0, 1) - (1, 2) - (3, 3)$
  </p>

  <p>
  Path 3 gives the coverage curve: $(0, 0) - (0, 1) - (0, 2) - (3, 3)$
  </p>

  <p>
  Path 4 gives the coverage curve: $(0, 0) - (0, 1) - (1, 1) - (1, 3) - (3, 3)$
  </p>

hint: |
  <p>
  For each hypothesis on a path count the number of positives and
  negatives covered, how can this be used to construct a coverage plot?
  </p>

comments: |
  <p>
  This question tests the students ability to derive coverage plots from
  paths through a hypothesis lattice.
  </p>

  <p>
  This question requires a reasonable amount of work, the student must
  first calculate the instances covered by each hypothesis and then use
  this information to construct a coverage plot
  </p>
