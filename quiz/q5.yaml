question:

  Given the above coverage plot depecting the performance of three classifiers and
  the details below, determine the dominant class by considerating their mapping to
  a ROC curve. Then compute its accuracy and average recall.

  $$
  \begin{align}
  Pos&= 25\\
  Neg&= 75\\
  \end{align}
  $$

  $$
  \begin{align}
  TP1&= 10\\
  TP2&=20\\
  TP3&= 20\\
  \end{align}
  $$

  $$
  \begin{align}
  FP1&= 15\\
  FP2&= 25\\
  FP3&= 40\\
  \end{align}
  $$

      The average recall of the best classifier

    <p>
    In a coverge plot, classifiers with the same accuracy are connected by line
    segments with slope 1. However, coverage plots do not take account of different
    class distributions. For this reason we should consider its normalised version
    which is reffered to as a ROC plot that explicitly takes the class distribution
    into account.

    From the given coverage plot we can therefore conclude that the C2 classifier is
    supperior to the C3 one as, while they both have the same true positives number of
    instances, C2 has a lower false positive number of instances. However, because of
    the different class distributions we cannot affirm that C1 is equivalent to C2 even
    if they have the same accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
    To be able to graffically represent their performance difference we have to normalise
    the data which will make noticable that they have different average recalls.
    This is due to the fact that even if the differences on the x and y axis do might include an equal
    amount of false and true positives instances, because the number of negatives instances
    is higher than the number of positive instances, the increase on the true positive axis
    will have a higher weight. This can be also observed when computing for both C1 nad C2
    their true positive / negatives rates that are included in the computation of average
    recall as fallows:
    </p>

    $$\text{average recall} = \frac{TPR + TNR}{2}$$
hint: |
  For each classifier compute their accuracy and average recall to aid you with
  deciding whether your choice is indeed the best classifier.

  Test the students ability to interpret the visualisation methods of a
  classification performance and the mapping of a coverage plot to a ROC curve.

  Complexity 3 because it requires a deep understanding of assessing classification
  performance and involves computing the accuracy and average recall in order to make
  a competent decision having no representation of a equivalent ROC plot .
