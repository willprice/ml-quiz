  <p>
  Given the score of six pairwise clssifiers
  $$
  \begin{align}
  ( C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6)=( +5, -0.5, +4, -0.5, +4 , +0.5)\\
  \end{align}
  $$
  compute their asymmetric one-versus-one scheme. Following this, compute their
  distances to the word w = +1 -1 +1 -1 +1 +1 using the exponential loss functions
  and the voting-based scheme and sort the classes according to your results
  in descending order of their favoritism.

answers:
  - correctness: "1"
    answer: "0.7"
    explanation: The accuracy of the best classifier
  - correctness: "2"
    answer: "0.7"
    explanation: |
      The average recall of the best classifier

workings: |
  <p>
  In a one-versus-one scheme each column of the matrice describes a binary
  classification task, using the class coressponding to the row with +1 entry
  as positive class and the class with the -1 entry as the negative class.
  Therefore, we train k(k-1)/2 binary classifiers, one for each pair of
  different classes. If a binary classifier treats the classes asymmetrically,
  we will train two classes for each pair, leading to a total of k(k-1)
  classifiers, where k is the number of total classes given.

hint: |
  <p>
  Computing their asymmetric one-versus-one scheme should aid the interpretation
  of the votes for the classes reprsented such that every c{i} character of the
  word equal with an entry on collumn i row j will represent a vote for the
  classifier C{j}.
  </p>
  <p>
  The same asymmetric one-versus-one scheme, but taking into consideration the
  score vector given, should aid the computation of L(z) = exp(-z).

comments: |
  Test student knowledge on using one-versus-one schemes to turn binary
  classifiers into multi-class classifiers.

  Complexity 3 because it requires interpretation of the voting scheme in
  parallel with computing the distances to the word using the exponential
  loss formula and outputing their possibly different results.
