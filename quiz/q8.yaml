  <h3>Debugging learning algorithms for high bias or high variance</h3>

  <p>
  When developing new learning algorithms and models it is common to
  obtain less than stellar performance, but why isn't your model
  performing as well as it should? Perhaps you could try adding more
  training data, maybe the model is underfitted, or overfitted, maybe
  the features derived from your data aren't sufficiently expressive.
  </p>

  <p>
  As you can see from the list above, there are many pitfalls that can
  cause your model to perform poorly. Which aspect do you choose to
  improve? Do you collect more training data, or do you try some
  different features representing your data, etc. As with any problem,
  without visibility into the problem, you are progressing blindly and
  you'll most likely pick the wrong avenue of improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
  The mean squared error (MSE) is commonly used to evaluate a model,
  $\hat{f}(x)$, output by a learning algorithm, the MSE can be decomposed
  into three components: The bias of the model, the variance of the model
  and finally the irreducible error (which is due to the noise in observed
  values).

  $$\mathrm{MSE}(\hat{f}(x)) =
    \underbrace{\sigma^2}_{\text{Irreducible error}} +
    \mathrm{Var}[\hat{f}(x)] +
    (\mathrm{Bias}[\hat{f}(x)])^2
  $$
  </p>

  <p>
  There are a variety of visualisation techniques we can use to better
  understand the problems of the trained model. Learning curves show how
  the accuracy (or some other evaluation metric) of models produced by a
  learning algorithm vary as we increase the training set size.
  </p>

  <p>
  Using your knowledge of bias and variance, interpret the following
  plots and match each plot to the property of the model the plot is
  revealing.

  <b>Model evaluation</b>
  <br />
  Match the model with the type of bias/variance
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Learning curves</b>
  <br />
  Match up the learning curve with the type of error the model displays

answers:
  - correctness: "Model evaluation: A"
    answer: "Model evaluation: High bias"
    explanation: |
      The estimator underfits the training data causing the expected error
      of the estimator to be different from the expected error of the
      k
    answer: "Model evaluation: Low bias, low variance"
    explanation: |
      The trained model is very close to the underlying distribution.
  - correctness: "Model evaluation: C"
    answer: "Model evaluation: High variance"
    explanation: |
      The estimator overfits the training data, the expected error of
      the estimator will be close to the expected error of the true
      function, however where there is little training data the
      estimator produces widely inaccurate predictions causing the
      estimator to have  high variance (i.e. the spread of predictions
      is much larger than the spread of data sampled from the true
      distribution)
  - correctness: "Learning curve A"
    answer: "Learning curve: High bias"
    explanation: |

  - correctness: "Learning curve B"
    answer: "Learning curve: High variance"
    explanation: |
      The training score shows that the model has fit the training data
      almost perfectly, however with smaller training sets the cross
      validation score considerably lower than the training score. As
      the training set size increases the cross validation score
      improves suggesting that better performance can be obtained by
      training the model on a large training set.

  Recall the following figure from the book
  </p>

  <div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="./img/dartboards.png" alt="Dartboard visualisation of variance and bias">
  </div>

  <p>
  The four dartboards from the top left clockwise demonstrate good
  predicition, predictions with high variance, predictions with high
  variance and bias, and predictions with high bias.
  </p>

  <p>
  Consider the linear regressor trying to fit the data in Fig 1,
  regardless of the parameters it will be unable to achieve good
  regression performance. For similar features the prediction will
  be similar but will be far away from the true value.
  </p>

  <p>
  Consider the polynomial of degree 15 regressor trying to fit the data
  in Fig 1, it achieves good training performance, but the plot shows
  how for small steps away from training examples the prediction varies
  wildly from the true value, since there is no consistency to these errors,
  the regressor has high variance.

  Tests the student's knowledge of bias and variance, introduces them to
  learning curves and asks them to understand how the learning curve
  looks for models with high variance and for models with high bias.
  </p>

  <p>
  Complexity 4 because the bias-variance trade off is a starred topic,
  and learning curves aren't covered in the book.
